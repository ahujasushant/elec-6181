This readme will guide you to run the Experiment 5 (Network with Shaping and Policing).

Following description refers to the nam trace file generated by the simulation
run.

Following files have been submitted along the submission as the source code of the project.
- package.ned
- omnetpp.ini
- OSPFConfig.xml
- filters.xml
- README

To run the project on your system, one should install Omnet++ 5.6.2 version on their system and INET 4.2.2 Framework.

After installing these two versions, create a New Omnet Project.
Once, the project is created, place the above files in the src directory of the project created.

From the properties of the Project, Add Project References and Choose inet from the list available.

Now, to run the simulation, right click on the omnetpp.ini file in the src directory and choose Run As Omnet++ Simulation.

This would open a new window.

From the drop down, choose the experiment you want to run.

Once selected Click on Run from the top left corner to run the simulation and wait.

It may take sometime.

After the successful completion of the simulation, one can check the results directory in src folder generated.

I have also added a git repo for this project, which can be found at: https://github.com/ahujasushant/elec-6181
